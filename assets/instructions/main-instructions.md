This is an experiment about how people learn. You will complete a series of trials in which there are several buckets. One of the buckets will have a coin in it. You should **click the bucket** where you think the coin is.

Different buckets have different probabilities of having the coin. Those probabilities are the same across trials. The image below shows an example where the coin is in the red bucket.

You will **read a message**, then complete a **test phase**.

The message was written by a previous participant who observed the same buckets and saw where the coin was several times. In the test phase, you will be asked to predict where the coin is, but you will not get any feedback after making guesses.

One trial has been randomly chosen as the *bonus trial*. If you guess where the coin is correctly on the bonus trial, you will get a **bonus of 50 cents**.

Press "Next" to see the message that a previous participant left for you.
