In this experiment, a machine drops coins into buckets with different probabilities. Another participant observed coins landing in different buckets. The experiment consists of two phases:

1. Read a message from a previous participant
2. Predict how likely the coin is to be in each bucket

---

In the first phase of the experiment, you will **read a message** from a previous participant who saw the same buckets. The previous participant was instructed to write a message that helps you learn about the probabilities, but they only had ${messageWritingTime} seconds to write the message.

---

Next, you will be asked to predict how likely a coin is to be in each bucket. Imagine a million coins were dropped into buckets, what percentage of them do you think would fall in each of the buckets?

You will make a prediction using this interface:

The interface asks you to report your confidence along with probabilities. You should use the slider to adjust your confidence so that are **95% sure** that the true probability is in the shaded region. You will earn a **bonus** if the true probability is in the shaded region. Your bonus will be larger the smaller the region is.

Press "Next" when you are ready to see the message that a previous participant left for you.
